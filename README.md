# World Cruises Database Project
This project involved designing, implementing, and managing a relational database system for a cruise booking company, World Cruises. It demonstrates my skills in applying relational database principles, developing sound database designs, and performing advanced data management using SQL.
## Overview
The database supports the operations of World Cruises, which manages cruise bookings, passenger details, ship operations, and manifests. This project covers the full lifecycle of database development, including schema design, data population, transaction handling, and schema modification.
## Key Deliverables
1. **Database Definition Language (DDL)**
- **Database Schema Implementation**: Designed and implemented database tables with proper constraints using Oracle SQL by creating and altering database objects.
2. **Data Population**
- Inserted realistic sample data into the database, including:
  - 15 passenger records, with at least five minors.
  - 30 manifest records, representing various booking scenarios.
3. **Data Manipulation Language and Querying (DML)**
- Implemented SQL queries to handle:
  - Dynamic cruise booking processes, including adding, updating, and canceling bookings.
  - Transaction management for consistent and reliable data operations.
4. **Database Modification**
- Enhanced database functionality by adding attributes and tables to meet evolving requirements, such as:
  - Tracking passenger counts per cruise.
  - Recording ship maintenance schedules.
  - Maintaining guardian history for minor passengers across multiple cruises.
## Technologies Used
- **Oracle SQL Developer**: Used for schema design, data manipulation, and testing.
- **GitLab**: Managed version control and demonstrated development history.
- **SQL**: Utilized for database operations, including DDL, DML, and advanced queries.

**Conclusion** This project strengthened my skills in relational database design, SQL development, and transaction management. It also honed my ability to solve complex data management challenges in a structured and efficient manner.
